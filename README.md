# Society of Renewal ‚Äì Landing Experience

Production-ready Next.js application for the Society of Renewal waitlist. The page delivers a cinematic droplet intro, persistent ripple CTA, and a fully accessible form that feeds a Postgres-backed queue with double opt-in email confirmation.

## Features

- üåì Dark-first visuals with `prefers-reduced-motion` safeguards and Framer Motion micro-interactions
- üíß Lottie droplet overlay that gracefully skips when motion is reduced
- üåä First-hover ripple CTA that persists its final glow and records analytics events
- üì¨ Waitlist form (React Hook Form + Zod) with lottery/need paths, rate-limiting, and Turnstile verification hooks
- üóÑÔ∏è Kysely schema + migration targeting Vercel Postgres; Vercel KV-based IP throttling fallback to in-memory for local dev
- üìà Vercel Analytics wired for page and custom event tracking
- üìÆ Resend (or compatible provider) double opt-in emails with confirm endpoint
- üîê SEO + social primitives (`metadata`, `opengraph-image`, `robots`, `sitemap`)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to see the site. Animations react to your OS motion preferences automatically.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` (or `.env`) file in the project root:

```bash
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY=your-resend-or-postmark-key
RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=optional
TURNSTILE_SECRET=optional
KV_REST_API_URL=optional
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=optional
```

- `EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY` accepts any provider supported by Resend‚Äôs SDK. Without it the app logs confirmation links to the console during local development.
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET` activates Cloudflare Turnstile verification; omit to skip validation in development.
- `KV_*` enables Vercel KV rate-limiting. Without it, requests fall back to an in-memory store.

#### How to obtain each value

- **Postgres (`POSTGRES_URL`)** ‚Äì In Vercel, add the Postgres integration and copy the `POSTGRES_URL` from **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**. Locally you can point to your own Postgres instance and place the URI here (or in `DATABASE_URL`).
- **Email (`EMAIL_PROVIDER_API_KEY` / `RESEND_API_KEY`)** ‚Äì Create an API key in [Resend](https://resend.com/dashboard/api-keys) or Postmark. Paste the secret here; without it the app logs confirmation links instead of sending email.
- **Turnstile (`TURNSTILE_SECRET`)** ‚Äì Visit [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile), create a site for your domain, choose Managed or Invisible mode, and copy the secret key. Leaving it unset simply disables verification.
- **Vercel KV (`KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`)** ‚Äì Vercel KV is a managed, Redis-compatible key-value store. Create one in the Vercel dashboard, then copy the REST URL and token. When absent, the rate limiter automatically falls back to an in-memory Map for development.

### Database Migrations

Run migrations with:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

The migrator uses `src/db/migrations` and targets the configured `DATABASE_URL` (Vercel Postgres ready).

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` ‚Äì start the Next.js dev server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` ‚Äì production build
- `npm run start` ‚Äì serve the production build
- `npm run lint` ‚Äì run ESLint
- `npm run format` ‚Äì validate Prettier + Tailwind class ordering
- `npm run format:write` ‚Äì auto-format with Prettier
- `npm run db:migrate` ‚Äì apply all pending Kysely migrations

### Editor Setup

- Install the recommended VS Code/Cursor extensions (ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind CSS) when prompted, or manually from `.vscode/extensions.json`.
- Format and lint on save are preconfigured via `.vscode/settings.json`, so Prettier handles ordering while ESLint fixes actionable rule violations.

## Architecture Notes

- **App Router** with TypeScript, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui primitives, and Vercel Turbo mode
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (`DropletIntro`, `RippleButton`, form reveals) honoring reduced-motion
- **Data layer:** `@vercel/postgres-kysely` + typed schema, confirmation tokens hashed via Node crypto
- **API routes:**
  - `POST /api/waitlist` ‚Äì stores/updates entries, rate-limits, sends confirmation email
  - `GET /api/waitlist/confirm` ‚Äì activates pending entries
  - `GET /api/health` ‚Äì liveness & database reachability report
- **Analytics:** `@vercel/analytics` with custom event hooks for ripple + form states
- **Deploy:** Optimized for Vercel. Remember to run `npm run db:migrate` as a build/deploy step and populate secrets in the Vercel dashboard.

## QA Checklist

- Reduced-motion bypasses droplet and ripple yet keeps final glow
- Waitlist form validates, announces status, and submits via keyboard
- Duplicate emails return a friendly confirmation state
- Links open in new tabs with `rel="noopener"`
- OpenGraph image renders the dark hero card

If you extend the project (e.g., add LMS tooling, build member dashboards), keep the landing light‚Äî‚â§200‚ÄØKB above the fold without the Lottie asset.
