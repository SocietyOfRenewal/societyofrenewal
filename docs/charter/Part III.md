# PART III

SAFEGUARDS, RESTORATION, AND PEACEKEEPING
_De-escalation · Protection · Truth · Repair · External Peace_

> **Scope.** Part III defines how the Society of Renewal responds to harm—interpersonal, structural, or external—while upholding the Dignity Constraint and the primacy of education and guidance over punishment. No clause herein authorizes domination, humiliation, or erasure.

---

## ARTICLE 6. FIRST PRINCIPLES OF SAFETY

**Section 6.1 — Dignity First.**
Every response to harm must preserve the dignity and safety of all involved, including those who caused harm.

**Section 6.2 — Minimum Necessary Force.**
The Society shall use the least intrusive, least forceful, most reversible intervention capable of stopping imminent harm.

**Section 6.3 — Education Over Control.**
Interventions must orient toward understanding, de-escalation, and skill-building, not intimidation or retribution.

**Section 6.4 — Transparency with Privacy.**
Process integrity is public; intimate details are protected. The public has the right to verify fairness; individuals have the right to boundaries.

**Section 6.5 — Non-Retaliation.**
No member is to be penalized for reporting harm, seeking help, or participating in restorative processes in good faith.

---

## ARTICLE 7. THE COMMUNITY SAFETY NETWORK (CSN)

**Section 7.1 — Composition.**
The CSN consists of trained **De-escalators**, **Mediators**, **Care Coordinators**, **Trauma Stewards**, and **Forensic Truthkeepers**, supported by accredited machine intelligences.

**Section 7.2 — Mandate.**
The CSN’s sole mandate is to prevent and reduce harm through de-escalation, protection, care, truth-finding, and restorative pathways. It exercises no punitive authority.

**Section 7.3 — Training & Accreditation.**
All CSN roles require standardized training in trauma-informed practice, bias awareness, conflict navigation, consent, youth/vulnerable-person protection, and non-violent crisis intervention. Accreditation and continuing education are recorded in Essentia.

**Section 7.4 — Availability.**
The CSN operates continuous coverage via local circles and remote mesh support. Access points must be simple: tap, call, or flag from any Society surface.

---

## ARTICLE 8. CRISIS RESPONSE PROTOCOL

**Section 8.1 — Triggers.**
Crisis response may be initiated upon credible signals of imminent harm, acute distress, or urgent environmental or cyber risk.

**Section 8.2 — Triage.**
De-escalators rapidly assess: (a) immediate safety, (b) medical/psychological needs, (c) conflict context, (d) presence of weapons or environmental hazards.

**Section 8.3 — Steps.**

1. **Contact & Calm** — establish safety, invite cooperation.
2. **Stabilize** — disengage threats, summon care.
3. **Separate (if needed)** — see Article 9.
4. **Document** — create a sealed, tamper-evident incident capsule.
5. **Route** — assign a restorative pathway (Article 10) and needed supports.

**Section 8.4 — Prohibited Practices.**
No chokeholds, pain compliance, humiliation rituals, indefinite restraint, black-box transport, or secret detentions. Any necessary restraint must be time-bounded, recorded, and medically monitored.

---

## ARTICLE 9. TEMPORARY PROTECTIVE SEPARATION (TPS)

**Section 9.1 — Nature.**
TPS is a **non-carceral** safety measure used only to prevent imminent harm. It is not punishment.

**Section 9.2 — Conditions.**
TPS must be:
(a) **Least restrictive** sufficient setting;
(b) **Time-bounded** with automatic review checkpoints (e.g., 1h, 6h, 24h);
(c) **Oversight-supervised** by a rotating community panel;
(d) **Care-paired** (food, water, medical/psych support, communication with an advocate).

**Section 9.3 — Rights.**
Separated individuals retain rights to: respectful treatment, information about the reason and timeline, access to counsel/advocate, to contest separation at each review, and to a rapid transition into a restorative plan.

**Section 9.4 — Tools.**
When geography allows, the Society prefers **geofenced distancing** and **social-graph boundaries** (no-contact channels, mediated exchanges) over physical confinement.

---

## ARTICLE 10. RESTORATIVE PATHWAYS

**Section 10.1 — Victim-Centered, Consent-based.**
Those harmed define what “being made whole” entails. Participation in dialogue requires their informed consent; alternatives must exist when consent is not possible.

**Section 10.2 — Components.**
Restoration may include: acknowledgment of harm, material repair, service to those affected, learning modules, mentorship, monitored commitments, and community reintegration ceremonies.

**Section 10.3 — Non-Participation.**
If a person declines participation, the Society still provides care and protective measures. If the person who caused harm refuses engagement, the Society may extend TPS-adjacent safeguards while continuing outreach and education.

**Section 10.4 — Completion & Memory.**
Upon completion, the outcome is recorded as **Repaired** with context in Essentia’s sealed memory (visible to parties and stewards; public summaries may be anonymized). Records emphasize learning, not stigma.

---

## ARTICLE 11. TRUTH, EVIDENCE, AND FAIRNESS

**Section 11.1 — Forensic Truthkeeping.**
Incident capsules (sensor logs, testimonies, environment captures) are sealed at creation, cryptographically timestamped to the Essentia Blockchain, and access-controlled.

**Section 11.2 — Chain of Custody.**
Every access, copy, or analysis action is logged and reviewable. Alterations are cryptographically impossible without detection.

**Section 11.3 — Privacy by Design.**
Only those with standing (parties, advocates, designated stewards, review circles) may view raw capsules. Public accountability is achieved via redacted summaries and verifiable hashes.

**Section 11.4 — Bias & Error Audit.**
Machine analyses must expose models, confidence, and potential bias. Human reviewers must be diverse and rotated. Any finding is contestable; counter-analysis is guaranteed.

---

## ARTICLE 12. REVIEW, APPEAL, AND OMBUDS

**Section 12.1 — Multi-Layer Review.**
Any party may appeal to:
(a) **Local Review Circle** (rapid),
(b) **Regional Assembly Panel** (deeper),
(c) **Global Ombuds Network** (systemic concerns).

**Section 12.2 — Timelines.**
Each layer has defined, short decision windows. Delays must be justified publicly (redacted where needed).

**Section 12.3 — Remedies.**
Remedies include: process corrections, new mediations, material repair, apology pathways, steward retraining, or overturning prior determinations.

---

## ARTICLE 13. PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AND THE VULNERABLE

**Section 13.1 — Heightened Duty of Care.**
Responses involving minors, elders, disabled persons, and others at heightened risk must prioritize specialized practitioners and settings.

**Section 13.2 — Safe Reporting.**
Any person may signal concern without fear of reprisal. False, malicious reporting is itself treated as harm and routed through education and repair.

**Section 13.3 — Consent & Agency.**
Developmentally appropriate consent and assent are required in all interactions; guardianship is monitored to prevent misuse.

---

## ARTICLE 14. EXTERNAL RELATIONS AND COLLECTIVE DEFENSE

**Section 14.1 — Doctrine of Non-Aggression.**
The Society does not initiate violence. It invests first in diplomacy, mutual aid, transparency, and independent verification.

**Section 14.2 — If Attacked.**
The Society’s defense posture is: **Protect, Evacuate, Disable Harm, De-escalate, Repair.**
Non-lethal and infrastructure-targeted measures are preferred to force that risks civilian dignity or life.

**Section 14.3 — No Occupation.**
Even in defense, the Society does not occupy, annex, or exploit. Prisoners or detainees are treated with dignity and routed to restorative processes as soon as safely feasible.

**Section 14.4 — Peacemaking Corps.**
A voluntary corps specializes in conflict mediation between the Society and external actors, maintaining open channels and proposing verifiable ceasefire frameworks.

**Section 14.5 — Witnessing.**
During conflicts, the Society invites neutral observers and publishes verifiable evidence capsules to deter atrocity and misinformation.

---

## ARTICLE 15. CYBER, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND INFORMATION SAFETY

**Section 15.1 — Mesh Resilience.**
Critical services (identity, UBI, knowledge, safety signaling) must remain available under attack via the Ark-grade mesh and graceful degradation.

**Section 15.2 — Defensive Posture.**
Active defense includes rapid patching, isolation of compromised nodes, and authenticated broadcast of advisories. Offensive cyber operations are restricted to disabling active harm with strict proportionality.

**Section 15.3 — Truth Health.**
Coordinated misinformation that materially endangers safety is addressed through rapid context, source transparency, and education—not censorship by default. Removal is reserved for direct incitement to dehumanize or explicit operational harm.

---

## ARTICLE 16. DISASTER, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND ECOLOGICAL RESPONSE

**Section 16.1 — Mutual Aid First.**
In disasters, the Society mobilizes immediate shelter, food, water, medical triage, and family connectivity through pre-planned community nodes.

**Section 16.2 — Science-Guided Measures.**
Public health responses (e.g., during pandemics) prioritize transparent evidence, free access to care, and non-punitive guidance. Coercive mandates require supermajority approval and strict time limits.

**Section 16.3 — Ecological Stewardship.**
Environmental harms trigger restoration plans with affected communities, using best-available science and indigenous/local knowledge.

---

## ARTICLE 17. SUNSET OF COERCION

**Section 17.1 — Harm-Use Accounting.**
All uses of TPS, restraint, or force are logged, reviewed, and published in aggregated, privacy-preserving form.

**Section 17.2 — Reduction Targets.**
The Society sets and publishes annual targets to reduce coercive interventions, investing upstream in education, care, housing, and community cohesion.

**Section 17.3 — Continuous Refactoring.**
If any practice drifts toward domination or humiliation, it must be redesigned or abolished in the next Refactoring Cycle.

---

### CLOSING CLAUSE OF PART III

Part III operationalizes safety without police, justice without courts, and defense without conquest. Where the old world relied on fear to compel order, we commit to **understanding to restore it**. Where force is unavoidable, we bind it with time, care, transparency, and the Dignity Constraint. Our aim is not merely to end harm, but to end its causes.

---

If you want, I can also draft the **Design Notes** that pair with this (the human-readable “why this works” companion) and a **playbooks index** (de-escalation scripts, TPS checklists, evidence capsule formats) to live in Essentia.

# PART III · ADDENDA

IMMEDIATE HARM INTERDICTION & DEFENSE

> **Intent.** These Articles specify how the Society of Renewal prevents and interrupts active lethal harm, and how it defends against organized violence or existential threats, without importing carceral policing or conquest militaries. All force is bounded by the Dignity Constraint and subject to strict audit, review, and sunset.

---

## ARTICLE 18. IMMEDIATE HARM INTERDICTION (ACTIVE THREATS)

**Section 18.1 — Triggers (Active / Imminent).**
Immediate Interdiction may be activated on credible signals of:
(a) ongoing lethal assault (e.g., firearm discharge, bladed attack, vehicle-as-weapon),
(b) coordinated mass attack, or
(c) imminent lethal threat assessed by multiple independent signals (human calls, sensors, forensic AIs).

**Section 18.2 — Authority & Oversight.**
Activation requires any _two_ of: on-scene De-escalator, remote CSN Watch Officer, or automated trigger reaching quorum from independent sensors. All activations are auto-logged to Essentia with a sealed hash.

**Section 18.3 — Rules of Protective Engagement (RPE).**

1. **Protect first.** Create distance, cover, and safe corridors for civilians.
2. **Disable second.** Neutralize the threat’s _capacity_ to harm with the least intrusive effective means.
3. **Preserve life.** Lethal force is permitted only to prevent otherwise unavoidable loss of life and ends the instant the lethal risk ends.
4. **Document continuously.** Body/scene telemetry is cryptographically sealed for later review with privacy safeguards.
5. **Handover to restoration.** As soon as safe, shift to medical care, debrief, and restorative pathways (Art. 10).

**Section 18.4 — Graduated Tools (Non-lethal Preferred).**
Authorized toolchain, least-to-most intrusive, chosen by context:

- acoustic and visual disorientation;
- drone-deployed obscurants and foam/gel entanglers;
- smart net launchers and mobile shields;
- vehicle interdiction (remote immobilizers, spike-bots);
- RF/jamming against remotely triggered devices;
- incapacitating projectiles where permitted by medical safety boards;
- **lethal means** only under RPE 3, with mandatory post-action review.

**Section 18.5 — Architecture for Survival.**
Society facilities must implement: compartmentable corridors, ballistic/fragmentation-rated refuges, auto-locking safe rooms with medical kits, clearly signed egress routes, and panic beacons that notify CSN and guide civilians to safety. Drills are educational, not terrorizing.

**Section 18.6 — Civic Protocol for Bystanders.**
Civilians are taught three defaults: **Move/Shield/Signal.**

- Move to signed safe corridors or refuges;
- Shield with available barriers;
- Signal via beacon/app/voice for location and status.
  Interference with responders is prohibited; lifesaving assistance after scene control is welcomed and coordinated.

**Section 18.7 — Aftermath & Memory.**
All uses of force trigger: medical triage for all affected (including the person who caused harm), immediate family liaison, trauma stewardship, and a public, privacy-preserving incident brief. A detailed audit (Art. 12) follows, with findings fed back into training and design. No spectacle; only truth and repair.

---

## ARTICLE 19. WEAPONS, DANGEROUS TECH, AND ACCESS CONTROLS

**Section 19.1 — Consent to Safe Zones.**
Entry into Society spaces constitutes consent to carry policies: prohibited classes (e.g., explosives), required safeties/storage, and geofenced restrictions where technically feasible. Violations route to de-arming + restorative education; malicious intent routes to Interdiction.

**Section 19.2 — No Autonomous Lethality.**
Autonomous lethal decision-making is prohibited. All lethal authorization requires meaningful human judgment, recorded reasoning, and post-action review.

**Section 19.3 — Open Audit.**
All interdiction tools and models (non-lethal and lethal) undergo independent medical/ethical review. Capabilities are documented; exploit paths are reported and patched, not hidden.

**Section 19.4 — Source Control.**
Manufacture, import, and storage of high-risk devices are tracked in Essentia with tamper-evident logs, subject to community audit panels.

---

## ARTICLE 20. DEFENSE CORPS & ETHIC (THE SOCIETY’S “MILITARY”)

**Section 20.1 — Mandate.**
Protect lives, preserve the commons, deter aggression, and end violence with minimum necessary force. No conquest, no occupation, no resource extraction.

**Section 20.2 — Composition.**

- **Shield & Rescue** (civilian protection, evacuation, mass-casualty care),
- **Interdiction Units** (counter-assault, counter-sabotage, CBRN containment),
- **Cyber & Signals** (mesh resilience, counter-intrusion, truth health),
- **Defense Engineering** (hardening, sensors, shelters, rapid repairs),
- **Mediation/Peacemaking Corps** (diplomacy during/after conflict).

**Section 20.3 — Command & Civilian Control.**
Mission command is distributed, with clear doctrine and authenticated orders. Civilian oversight is continuous via elected review circles with emergency recall powers. All operations are logged with sealed hashes for later verification.

**Section 20.4 — ROE Mirrors RPE.**
Non-aggression, distinction, proportionality, and reversibility govern every action. Weapons and tactics chosen to disable capacity, not to punish identity.

**Section 20.5 — Treatment of Captured Persons.**
All persons are treated with dignity, provided care, and routed toward restorative processes as soon as feasible. Torture, disappearance, indefinite detention, and collective punishment are categorically banned.

---

## ARTICLE 21. EXTERNAL WAR & PEACE ARCHITECTURE

**Section 21.1 — First, Make Peace.**
Default posture is transparency, verifiable facts, humanitarian corridors, and third-party observers. The Society publishes evidence capsules to counter propaganda and reduce miscalculation.

**Section 21.2 — If Attacked.**
Layered defense prioritizes:
(a) protect/evacuate civilians;
(b) disable attack vectors (cyber, comms, logistics) with minimal collateral harm;
(c) create space for ceasefire and mediation;
(d) document everything for repair and accountability.

**Section 21.3 — No First Strike Doctrine.**
The Society does not initiate hostilities. Pre-emption is reserved for credible, imminent mass harm and requires supermajority authorization and independent verification.

**Section 21.4 — Sunset & Repair.**
Emergency authorities auto-expire and require active renewal. Post-conflict, the Society funds and participates in repair—physical, social, ecological—on all affected sides.

---

## ARTICLE 22. PLANETARY & EXTRATERRESTRIAL DEFENSE

**Section 22.1 — Planetary Hazards.**
The Society contributes to open, global sky-survey networks, early-warning meshes, and deflection/mitigation programs for asteroids/comets/space debris. Data and mission designs are public by default.

**Section 22.2 — First Contact Protocol.**
Contact is treated as diplomatic and scientific, not military, by default. A multilingual/semio-logical team leads with broadcast transparency and consent principles.

**Section 22.3 — Hostile Non-Human Actors (Low Probability, High Impact).**
If hostile action threatens conscious life, RPE/ROE apply at planetary scale: disable capacity with minimum harm, protect habitats, seek de-escalation and communication at every stage. Prisoners are persons.

**Section 22.4 — AI as Partner, Not Master.**
Machine intelligences may advise, simulate outcomes, and operate defensive infrastructure, but cannot self-authorize lethal action. All high-risk autonomy has human fail-safes and physical interlocks.

---

## ARTICLE 23. PASSION KILLINGS, SERIAL HARM, AND ORGANIZED VIOLENCE

**Section 23.1 — Crimes of Passion (Acute).**
When lethal harm erupts from acute emotional dysregulation, responders follow Interdiction to stop harm, then route immediately to: trauma care, cooling-off TPS (Art. 9), and a mediated pathway designed specifically for acute dysregulation (grief, rage, betrayal) with specialized stewards.

**Section 23.2 — Serial or Patterned Harm.**
Where a person exhibits repeated, patterned violence, the Society employs longer-horizon restorative plans: intensive mentorship/therapy, structured boundaries, monitored commitments, and—only if necessary—extended TPS with periodic review, always coupled with education and community supports. The aim is transformation, not warehousing.

**Section 23.3 — Organized Violence.**
When violence is coordinated (gangs, militias, state actors), the response blends Interdiction, Defense Corps action, and deep mediation channels to peel individuals away from violent structures, offering exits, amnesty with repair, and replacement identities/economic pathways.

---

## ARTICLE 24. PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY & SUNSET OF FORCE

**Section 24.1 — Harm Ledger (Privacy-Preserving).**
All uses of force, TPS, interdiction, and defense actions are published in aggregate dashboards with redactions to protect individuals: counts, contexts, tools used, injuries, and outcomes.

**Section 24.2 — Reduction Targets.**
The Society sets yearly targets to reduce coercive episodes via upstream investment (housing, care, education, connection). Missing targets triggers automatic review and budget reallocation toward root-cause mitigation.

**Section 24.3 — Mandatory Post-Incident Learning.**
Every interdiction event must yield a public “What We Changed” note in Essentia: training updated, architecture improved, tools refined, doctrine clarified.

---

### Plain-language note (for our Rationale/Design Notes, not the Charter text)

- **Active shooters / mass attacks:** we prioritize **shielding civilians and disabling the attacker’s capacity** with non-lethals (foam, nets, obscurants, jammers) and **permit lethal force only when nothing else will stop ongoing killing**—and only for as long as that risk exists.
- **Crimes of passion:** after stopping harm, we treat the _state_ (shock, rage, loss) as the target of intervention—cooling-off separation, trauma-literate mediation, and long-term guidance.
- **Serial harm:** we commit to long-arc transformation plans with real boundaries that keep others safe, audited frequently so “temporary separation” never becomes a quiet prison.
- **Defense/military:** yes, we have one—built to **protect and de-escalate**, never to rule or conquer. Everything is logged, overseen, and expires unless renewed.
- **Planetary defense/aliens:** we lead with science and diplomacy; if forced to fight, we fight to **disable**, not to dominate; prisoners remain persons.

# PART III · ADDENDA (CONT.)

## ARTICLE 25. UNIVERSAL PREVENTION EDUCATION (UPE)

**Section 25.1 — Purpose.**
The Society’s primary safety strategy is _prevention through education_. UPE exists to reduce the probability, intensity, and recurrence of harm such that Articles 18–24 are rarely, if ever, invoked.

**Section 25.2 — Core Curriculum (All Ages).**
UPE includes, at minimum:
(a) peace literacy and de-escalation skills;
(b) emotional regulation, trauma awareness, and peer support;
(c) restorative communication and repair practice;
(d) media literacy and misinformation immunity;
(e) basic public health and mental-health first aid;
(f) digital hygiene and cyber-safety;
(g) civics of the Society (DID, governance, UBI, rights & duties);
(h) bystander protocols (_Move / Shield / Signal_) and refuge drills.

**Section 25.3 — Coverage & Cadence.**
UPE is delivered continuously in schools, workplaces, community circles, and onboarding. Refresher micro-trainings are offered quarterly; scenario drills are non-militarized, dignity-preserving, and opt-out only for documented trauma accommodations (with alternatives provided).

**Section 25.4 — Open & Global.**
All UPE materials are Open Educational Resources, free to translate, adapt, and republish. Non-members may access the full curriculum without restriction.

**Section 25.5 — Measurement & Targets.**
The Society publishes a **Prevention Coverage Index** (PCI) each quarter: % of population completing core units; incident rates per 10,000; average time-to-repair; participation in restorative pathways. Annual targets must trend PCI ↑ and coercive interventions ↓ (tie-in with Arts. 17 & 24).

**Section 25.6 — Non-Carceral Ethic.**
No UPE practice may shame, coerce confession, or simulate abuse. Drills and lessons must be trauma-informed and consent-aware.

---

## ARTICLE 26. GLOBAL EXPANSION & FEDERATION

**Section 26.1 — Mandate to Grow.**
The Society’s aim is planetary: to make education, dignity, and material security universal. Expansion is voluntary, transparent, and invitation-based.

**Section 26.2 — Federation Protocol.**
Communities may join as **Federated Nodes** by ratifying the Dignity Constraint and Parts I–III. Federation includes:
(a) mutual recognition of DIDs;
(b) cross-anchored governance records (hashes on Essentia and local ledgers where used);
(c) emergency roaming for members (identity + UBI portability);
(d) interoperability of learning, safety, and restorative systems.

**Section 26.3 — Open Curriculum & Translation.**
The Charter, UPE, and safety playbooks must be maintained in a translation pipeline so any language community can adopt them. Terminology is localized without diluting meaning.

**Section 26.4 — Diaspora & Allies.**
Members living under non-Society jurisdictions are supported by legal aid, encrypted communications, and safe-passage networks. Allies may mirror our materials and practices without formal federation.

**Section 26.5 — Invitational Diplomacy.**
Outreach favors service over rhetoric: offer learning, medics, mesh connectivity, and restorative expertise first. No conditionality of aid on political allegiance.

---

## ARTICLE 27. TRANSITIONAL PROTECTIVE POSTURE (UNTIL GLOBAL)

**Section 27.1 — Layered Safety.**
Until the Society’s coverage is global, Federated Nodes maintain layered protections: refuge architecture, Interdiction readiness (Art. 18), cyber/mesh resilience (Art. 15), and Defense Corps liaison (Art. 20), scaled to local risk.

**Section 27.2 — Safe-Zone Entry Rules.**
Society spaces may require peaceable-entry conditions (weapons storage, geofenced locks, contraband surrender) as a condition of presence. Noncompliance routes to de-arming + education; malicious intent routes to Interdiction.

**Section 27.3 — Cross-Border Protocol.**
Where external law conflicts with the Charter, nodes:
(a) default to the Dignity Constraint;
(b) seek lawful accommodations;
(c) document conflicts in Essentia;
(d) escalate to Federation counsel and Ombuds for response options that minimize risk to members.

**Section 27.4 — Humanitarian Corridors.**
Nodes maintain plans for civilian evacuation, medical supply, and food/water access under blockade or siege, coordinated with international observers.

**Section 27.5 — Sunset of Hardening.**
As PCI rises and harm rates fall, nodes must publish a schedule to _de-harden_ spaces, decommission intrusive controls, and reallocate resources to UPE (tie-in with Arts. 17 & 24).

---

## ARTICLE 28. READINESS WITHOUT MILITARIZATION

**Section 28.1 — Professional Readiness.**
Interdiction and Defense personnel train continuously—but their doctrine, tools, and metrics orient to _disabling harm and preserving life,_ not domination.

**Section 28.2 — Non-Lethal First.**
Procurement prioritizes non-lethal, reversible technologies and environmental design that obviate the need for force.

**Section 28.3 — Planetary Defense as Commons.**
Threat monitoring (asteroids, debris, biohazards) and countermeasures are treated as global public goods: open data, open designs, shared drills (tie-in with Art. 22).

**Section 28.4 — Education is the Long War.**
Annual strategy reviews must demonstrate that the _largest_ budget growth, personnel growth, and R&D growth are in UPE and restorative capacity—not in force projection.

---

### One-sentence ethos (for the Rationale/Design Notes, not the Charter text)

We keep the fire extinguisher charged, but we design a world that almost never lights the match.

If you want, I can now insert these Articles into your consolidated **Part III** draft and generate a tidy **diff** against the previous version so your Essentia wiki shows exactly what changed.
