Short answer: not yet. We've got a strong core, but a "complete first draft" needs a few more pillars and some glue.

### What’s already drafted

- **Part I** – Principles / Dignity Constraint (from earlier work)
- **Part II** – Operational Articles (Identity · Platform · Governance · UBI · Education)
- **Part III** – Safeguards, Restoration & Peacekeeping (+ active-threat interdiction, defense, prevention)
- **Part IV** – Open Membership, Federation & Invitation

### What’s still needed to call it a full v1

1. **Economy & Treasury (Part V)**
   Funding sources for UBI; currency definitions (Essent / Essential Units); issuing, reserves, anti-corruption, procurement, audits.
2. **Data, Privacy & Tech Ethics (Part VI)**
   Information rights, transparency vs. confidentiality, algorithmic accountability, model audits, retention & deletion, consent.
3. **Health, Care & Accessibility (Part VII)**
   Baseline care guarantees, mental-health & SUD supports, disability/accessibility standards, guardianship limits, end-of-life, reproductive autonomy.
4. **Environment & Commons (Part VIII)**
   Rights/responsibilities for land/water/air, regenerative standards, externalities, climate commitments, resource commons governance.
5. **Institutions & Roles (Part IX)**
   Circles/stewards/ombuds charters, elections/term limits/recall, conflicts of interest, minimal “civil service” definitions.
6. **Implementation & Ratification (Part X)**
   How this Charter comes into force, transitional articles, emergency powers & sunsets, versioning / Refactoring Cycle details.
7. **Interoperability & Treaties (Part XI)**
   Conflict-of-law handling, MOUs, safe-harbor agreements, diaspora protections (extend what we began in Part IV).
8. **Definitions & Annexes**
   Glossary (DID, TPS, UPE, etc.), plus the referenced playbooks (de-escalation, interdiction ROE/RPE cards, onboarding, facility specs).

If you want, I can compile everything we’ve written into a **single v0.1 Charter** (Parts I–IV) and scaffold the headers/placeholders for Parts V–XI so we can fill them next.
