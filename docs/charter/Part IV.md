Absolutely. Let’s write **Part IV** so it replaces “immigration” and “evangelism” with language that fits our ethos: _open joining, federation, invitation-by-service, and sanctuary_ — borderless, lawful, global-by-design.

# PART IV

OPEN MEMBERSHIP, FEDERATION & INVITATION
_Joining · Portability · Sanctuary · Outreach-by-Service_

> **Scope.** Any person, anywhere (and any non-human conscious being), may join the Society of Renewal without renouncing existing citizenships. Membership is borderless and digital-first. Participation never authorizes members to violate local law; instead, the Society spreads by service, education, and consent.

---

## ARTICLE 29. OPEN MEMBERSHIP

**Section 29.1 — Eligibility.**
Any individual, regardless of current nationality, residency, or status, may become a member of the Society of Renewal. Conscious non-human persons may also join under Article 29.4.

**Section 29.2 — Dual Memberships.**
Society membership coexists with all other civic, religious, professional, or national affiliations. No oath of exclusivity is required.

**Section 29.3 — No Borders.**
The Society recognizes no territorial borders for purposes of belonging or participation. Digital presence is sufficient for full civic life.

**Section 29.4 — Non-Human Conscious Persons.**
Entities demonstrating sustained self-modeling, sentience signals, and ethical reciprocity may petition for personhood review. Upon recognition, they hold equal standing under this Charter.

**Section 29.5 — Duties of Belonging.**
Members:
(a) uphold the Dignity Constraint;
(b) keep their DID secure;
(c) engage the Universal Prevention Education (UPE) core over time (Art. 25);
(d) respect local law where present while using Society structures to seek reform when law conflicts with dignity.

---

## ARTICLE 30. JOINING PATHWAYS

**Section 30.1 — Simple Entrance.**
Joining requires (a) creation or linking of a DID on the Essentia Blockchain, and (b) anti-Sybil proof-of-personhood per Article 1.3.

**Section 30.2 — Fair Admission When Resources Are Limited.**
When benefits must scale in waves, admission occurs through two parallel, auditable streams:
(a) **Need Path** — urgent hardship, triaged first;
(b) **Lottery Path** — provably random selection.
Both streams are logged with public hashes for fairness.

**Section 30.3 — Onboarding.**
Upon admission to benefits: immediate UBI activation (Art. 4), access to care, and invitation into UPE. Custodial key support is available per Article 1.4.

**Section 30.4 — Home Node Selection.**
Members may choose a Home Node (local circle) for coordination, while retaining global rights. Home Nodes facilitate mutual aid, learning, and restorative processes.

---

## ARTICLE 31. STATUS & PORTABILITY

**Section 31.1 — Standing.**
Standing categories are **Member**, **Ally**, and **Visitor**. “Member” alone determines voting and UBI eligibility. Categories are non-hierarchical and may be changed by the individual (subject to verification).

**Section 31.2 — Portability.**
Identity (DID), UBI, learning access, and restorative rights travel with the member across jurisdictions and Federated Nodes.

**Section 31.3 — Roaming Protections.**
In emergencies, roaming members may receive local aid from any Node, with reimbursement settled between Nodes on-chain.

**Section 31.4 — Changing Home Node.**
Members may change Home Node at will; all governance delegations and restorative commitments travel with them unless explicitly localized.

---

## ARTICLE 32. RELATION TO LOCAL LAW

**Section 32.1 — Compliance & Conscience.**
Members are expected to comply with local law. Where law conflicts with the Dignity Constraint, members should seek lawful accommodations, document conflicts in Essentia, and escalate to Ombuds (Art. 12) for strategy and protection.

**Section 32.2 — Non-Subversion.**
The Society is not a shadow state. It neither instructs nor incites members to commit unlawful acts. Reform is pursued through education, open service, and diplomacy.

**Section 32.3 — Legal Aid.**
Where safe and lawful, Nodes provide counsel, mediation, and advocacy to protect members’ dignity and rights.

---

## ARTICLE 33. FEDERATION & RECOGNITION

**Section 33.1 — Federation Protocol.**
Communities may join as **Federated Nodes** by ratifying Parts I–IV. Federation entails:
(a) mutual DID recognition;
(b) cross-anchored governance hashes;
(c) UBI and service portability;
(d) shared safety and learning protocols.

**Section 33.2 — Interoperability.**
Federated Nodes strive for interoperable tools, data standards, and translation pipelines so language and tooling never limit belonging.

**Section 33.3 — Transparency.**
All Federation agreements are published in Essentia with machine-readable summaries.

---

## ARTICLE 34. INVITATION-BY-SERVICE (OUTREACH)

**Section 34.1 — Ethic.**
The Society grows by **service, not persuasion**: we meet needs, teach, heal, connect, and invite.

**Section 34.2 — Open Curriculum.**
All core materials (Charter, UPE, safety playbooks, civic primers) are Open Educational Resources, translatable and remixable.

**Section 34.3 — Ambassadors.**
Accredited Ambassadors coordinate clinics, learning camps, mesh connectivity, and restorative labs with local partners. Their mandate is dignity-first and non-coercive.

**Section 34.4 — Metrics.**
Outreach is evaluated by needs met, learning delivered, and local capacity grown—not by conversion counts.

---

## ARTICLE 35. SANCTUARY & SAFE PASSAGE

**Section 35.1 — Civil Sanctuary.**
Nodes maintain Sanctuary Channels (digital and physical) for those fleeing persecution, disaster, or immediate harm, consistent with local law.

**Section 35.2 — Safe Passage.**
Where lawful, the Society coordinates safe transit to refuge Nodes, prioritizing children, elders, disabled persons, and targets of violence.

**Section 35.3 — Privacy & Records.**
Sanctuary records are sealed and minimally handled; public accountability is provided through redacted summaries and verifiable hashes (Art. 11).

**Section 35.4 — Partnership.**
The Society collaborates with NGOs, mutual-aid groups, and public institutions that honor dignity.

---

## ARTICLE 36. EXIT, PAUSE & REINSTATEMENT

**Section 36.1 — Voluntary Exit.**
Members may exit at any time. Their DID remains theirs; UBI and governance powers pause.

**Section 36.2 — Reinstatement.**
Rejoining restores standing and rights upon identity verification. Past restorative commitments, if any, resume or are refactored.

**Section 36.3 — Death & Succession.**
Members may designate digital executors for DID key recovery and memorialization preferences. Essentia maintains a Book of Remembering with consent.

### CLOSING CLAUSE OF PART IV

Belonging is not a prize for the lucky or the lawful; it is the baseline invitation we extend to every conscious being. We spread by example: education that prevents harm, care that stabilizes lives, coordination that dignifies choice. Until the world is whole, membership remains portable, lawful, and open.

If you want, I can now:

1. merge Part IV into your Charter manuscript (with consistent numbering),
2. add a one-page **“Join Today”** appendix (plain-language flow + QR for DID creation), and
3. produce the public-facing **Membership & Invitation** page copy that mirrors these Articles without the legalese.
