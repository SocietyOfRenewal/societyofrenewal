## Key Concepts

### The Dignity Constraint

The fundamental principle that no policy, process, tool, or tactic may demean, dehumanize, or erase any conscious being. This is the first boundary on power and the last refuge against its misuse.

### Declaration of Interdependence

A manifesto that diagnoses the problems with current systems and states the core commitments of the Society of Renewal, including:

- Dignity as the only stable constraint on power
- Education as the primary tool for preventing harm
- Material security as cognitive infrastructure
- Identity ownership by the person it represents
- Truth as verifiable and privacy as honored

### Scientific Foundation

The book provides evidence for:

- How scarcity affects human cognition and behavior
- Why education prevents more harm than punishment
- How restorative justice works in practice
- The effectiveness of Universal Basic Income
- The science behind decentralized identity systems
